# File Catalyst Take-home
## Objectives
1) Write a tool which accepts a millisecond-format timestamp (e.g. 1559153538243, 1559153537352) 
and returns a human-readable string. 
2) Write a tool to take a data set in a given format and output it as a line graph. 
You can use any graphing library you wish. 

## About this project


## How to access this project
Before you start, you will need to have Node.js and Mocha installed, 
and you will need to do an 'npm install' to install dependencies.
  
There are two ways to check out the functionality. 

1. In a terminal window, type 'npm run start' and navigate to localhost:8080 in a browser. 
You should see a basic web page showing a line graph representation of the data provided 
(and some time and date labels generated with a timestamp-format tool). 
2. Alternately, type 'npm test' in a terminal window to run all available tests of both
the data formatter and the timestamp tool.
